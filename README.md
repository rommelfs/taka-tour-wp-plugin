# TAKA Platform

**TAKA** means **Ticketing, Attendance, Knowledge & Administration**. The plugin is a reusable WordPress platform for international event and seminar tours: seminars, conferences, martial-arts events, workshops, festivals, concerts, community events and multi-location tours.

The TAKA European Tour 2026 remains the first reference implementation and bundled demo/fallback dataset, but it is no longer the product boundary.

## White-label direction

Core architecture uses the `TAKA_Platform_*` namespace, the `taka-platform` text domain and generic platform constants. Existing TAKA Tour class names, constants and shortcodes remain available through compatibility shims so existing sites keep working.

## Public shortcodes

Backward-compatible shortcodes:

- `[taka_homepage]`
- `[taka_tour_schedule]`
- `[taka_tickets]`
- `[taka_sponsor]`
- `[taka_language_switcher]`

Generic platform aliases:

- `[taka_platform_homepage]`
- `[taka_platform_schedule]`
- `[taka_platform_tickets]`
- `[taka_platform_sponsor]`
- `[taka_platform_language_switcher]`

Additional event-tour aliases:

- `[event_tour_homepage]`
- `[event_tour_schedule]`
- `[event_tour_tickets]`
- `[event_tour_sponsor]`
- `[event_tour_language_switcher]`
- `[taka_organizer_dashboard]`
- `[taka_platform_organizer_dashboard]`
- `[event_tour_organizer_dashboard]`

All aliases call the same rendering logic.

## WordPress-first data flow

WordPress is the primary live data source. If at least one `taka_event` post exists, the frontend renders published WordPress events. If no WordPress events exist, the plugin falls back to `config/tour-events.php` so a fresh install still renders the reference TAKA European Tour.

`config/tour-events.php` remains seed, demo, fallback, import/export and backup data.

## Admin CMS

The WordPress admin menu is branded **TAKA Platform** and includes:

- Dashboard
- Events (`taka_event`)
- Organizers (`taka_organizer`)
- Venues (`taka_venue`)
- Media
- Content Sections
- Import / Export
- Settings

The dashboard explains the long form: **TAKA – Ticketing, Attendance, Knowledge & Administration**. Settings expose editable hero copy, hero image/layout controls, overlay strength and readable text-box options. Content Sections expose editable Sensei, Training, Community, Host and Sponsor blocks with visibility, image, layout and sort controls.

## Organizer access control

Version 1.2.0 adds the `taka_organizer` role. Administrators can assign users to one or more organizer CPTs from the WordPress user profile. Organizer users can access the TAKA Platform dashboard, upload media and create/edit only events assigned to their organizer(s); administrators continue to manage everything. Version 1.3.0 adds a frontend organizer dashboard shortcode for focused self-service event listing, creation, editing and duplication.

## Data model

Events support tour/event concepts such as title, subtitle, description, organizer, venues, dates, times, doors-open, timezone, format, audience, level, ticket provider, ticket URL, action/group/gallery media, languages, notes, parking and sort order.

Organizers support legal names, websites, logos, contact data and social links. Venues support addresses, websites, parking/accessibility notes, geo data and venue/parking images.

## Import / Export

The Import / Export screen supports:

- bundled PHP config
- uploaded compatible PHP config
- pasted JSON with `organizers`, `venues` and `events`
- dry-run previews
- import missing only
- update existing
- overwrite existing
- optional deletion of existing plugin data before import

Imports are idempotent through stable `_taka_config_id` identifiers. Export provides a PHP config representation and JSON.

## Media handling

Media access is centralized in the data layer. Frontend image resolution priority is:

1. WordPress attachment ID
2. stored fallback URL
3. bundled config fallback
4. render nothing

The admin uses WordPress Media Library selection for global images, organizer logos, event images/galleries and venue images.

## Ticket providers

Pretix remains supported. Admins set:

- `ticket_provider = pretix`
- `ticket_shop_url = https://pretix.eu/.../`

The frontend automatically renders the correct Pretix widget plus a direct fallback link. The ticket layer now uses provider classes and a registry so Eventbrite, WooCommerce, TicketTailor or external URL providers can be added later.

## Multilingual frontend

Supported query-parameter languages: `?taka_lang=de`, `en`, `nl`, `fr`, `lb`, `fi`, `ja`. Static JSON translations in `translations/` are used for frontend labels. Missing keys fall back to German and then to the supplied template fallback.

The compact selector remains:

`🌍 🇩🇪 🇫🇷 🇳🇱 🇧🇪▼ 🇱🇺▼ 🇫🇮 🇯🇵`

## File structure

New platform modules live in smaller responsibility-based folders:

- `includes/Core/` plugin wiring and shortcode registration
- `includes/Admin/` native WordPress admin CMS
- `includes/Data/` repository/data-source logic
- `includes/Frontend/` shortcode renderer
- `includes/I18n/` static translation loader
- `includes/Tickets/` ticket-provider interface, Pretix provider and registry
- `includes/Support/` shared helper functions

Legacy `includes/class-taka-tour-*.php` files remain as thin compatibility shims.

Assets are split into platform files such as `assets/css/frontend.css`, `assets/css/admin.css`, `assets/css/language-switcher.css`, `assets/css/tickets.css`, `assets/js/frontend.js`, `assets/js/admin.js`, `assets/js/media-fields.js` and `assets/js/language-switcher.js` while legacy assets remain in place for compatibility.

## Migration notes

Existing pages using `[taka_homepage]` and existing CPT data (`taka_event`, `taka_organizer`, `taka_venue`) continue to work. Existing constants such as `TAKA_TOUR_VERSION` map to the new platform constants. Existing class names such as `Taka_Tour_Data` are aliased to the new `TAKA_Platform_*` classes.
