# TAKA Platform

**TAKA** means **Ticketing, Attendance, Knowledge & Administration**. The plugin is a reusable WordPress platform for international event and seminar tours: seminars, conferences, martial-arts events, workshops, festivals, concerts, community events and multi-location tours.

The TAKA European Tour 2026 remains the first reference implementation and bundled demo/fallback dataset, but it is no longer the product boundary.

## White-label direction

Core architecture uses the `TAKA_Platform_*` namespace, the `taka-platform` text domain and generic platform constants. Existing TAKA Tour class names, constants and shortcodes remain available through compatibility shims so existing sites keep working.

## Public shortcodes

Backward-compatible shortcodes:

- `[taka_homepage]`
- `[taka_tour_schedule]`
- `[taka_tickets]`
- `[taka_sponsor]`
- `[taka_language_switcher]`

Generic platform aliases:

- `[taka_platform_homepage]`
- `[taka_platform_schedule]`
- `[taka_platform_tickets]`
- `[taka_platform_sponsor]`
- `[taka_platform_language_switcher]`

Additional event-tour aliases:

- `[event_tour_homepage]`
- `[event_tour_schedule]`
- `[event_tour_tickets]`
- `[event_tour_sponsor]`
- `[event_tour_language_switcher]`
- `[taka_organizer_dashboard]`
- `[taka_platform_organizer_dashboard]`
- `[event_tour_organizer_dashboard]`

All aliases call the same rendering logic.

## WordPress-first data flow

WordPress is the primary live data source. If at least one `taka_event` post exists, the frontend renders published WordPress events. If no WordPress events exist, the plugin falls back to `config/tour-events.php` so a fresh install still renders the reference TAKA European Tour.

`config/tour-events.php` remains seed, demo, fallback, import/export and backup data.

## Admin CMS

The WordPress admin menu is branded **TAKA Platform** and includes:

- Dashboard
- Events (`taka_event`)
- Organizers (`taka_organizer`)
- Venues (`taka_venue`)
- Media
- Content Sections
- Import / Export
- Settings
- Translations

The dashboard explains the long form: **TAKA – Ticketing, Attendance, Knowledge & Administration**. Settings expose editable hero copy, hero image/layout controls, overlay strength, readable text-box options, ticket section headings and configurable booking information. Content Sections expose fully configurable homepage editorial blocks with add/delete controls, visibility, sort order, multilingual kicker/title/subtitle/body/button fields, layout/background styles, main/secondary images, galleries, image fit and image focus controls.

## Organizer access control

Version 1.2.0 adds the `taka_organizer` role. Administrators can assign users to one or more organizer CPTs from the WordPress user profile. Organizer users can access the TAKA Platform dashboard, upload media and create/edit only events assigned to their organizer(s); administrators continue to manage everything. Version 1.3.0 adds a frontend organizer dashboard shortcode for focused self-service event listing, creation, editing and duplication.

## Data model

Events support tour/event concepts such as title, subtitle, description, organizer, venues, dates, times, doors-open, timezone, format, audience, level, ticket provider, ticket URL, action/group/gallery media, languages, notes, parking and sort order.

Organizers support legal names, websites, logos, contact data, social links and repeatable co-organizers with their own logo, website, email, description and active/sort controls. Events can also use global or event-specific booking information for groups, multi-event discounts, payment and cancellation notes. Homepage content sections can be exported as portable config data and used as fallback/demo editorial content. Venues support addresses, websites, parking/accessibility notes, geo data and venue/parking images.

## Option lists

Recurring event fields such as audience and format use configurable option lists from **TAKA Platform -> Settings**. Events store stable option keys where possible, while unknown legacy text values remain valid and continue to render as fallback text. Option labels have a source language, translations, sort order and enabled state, and are included in TAKA Translation Packages.

## Hero route map

The Hero location overview supports configurable display modes: list, flags, route map and route map with list. The route map is a lightweight SVG/HTML tour infographic with clickable event stops, optional `route_map_x` / `route_map_y` event or venue coordinates, automatic route layout fallback, flags and an accessible fallback list for keyboard, screen-reader and mobile users. Legacy `map` and `map_with_list` display modes are normalized to the route map modes for backward compatibility.

## Import / Export

The Import / Export screen supports:

- bundled PHP config
- uploaded compatible PHP config
- pasted JSON with `organizers`, `venues` and `events`
- dry-run previews
- import missing only
- update existing
- overwrite existing
- optional deletion of existing plugin data before import

Imports are idempotent through stable `_taka_config_id` identifiers. Export provides a PHP config representation and JSON.

## Translation Packages

TAKA Translation Packages (TTP) provide a provider-independent JSON workflow for dynamic multilingual content. Editors can export untranslated or changed content, translate it with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepL or human translators, then import the completed JSON without an API requirement. See [docs/translations.md](docs/translations.md).

## Media handling

Media access is centralized in the data layer. Frontend image resolution priority is:

1. WordPress attachment ID
2. stored fallback URL
3. bundled config fallback
4. render nothing

The admin uses WordPress Media Library selection for global images, organizer logos, event images/galleries and venue images.

## Ticket providers

Pretix remains supported. Admins set:

- `ticket_provider = pretix`
- `ticket_shop_url = https://pretix.eu/.../`

The frontend automatically renders the correct Pretix widget plus a direct fallback link. The ticket layer now uses provider classes and a registry so Eventbrite, WooCommerce, TicketTailor or external URL providers can be added later.

## Multilingual frontend

Supported query-parameter languages: `?taka_lang=de`, `en`, `nl`, `fr`, `lb`, `fi`, `ja`. Static JSON translations in `translations/` are used for frontend labels. Missing keys fall back to German and then to the supplied template fallback.

The compact selector remains:

`🌍 🇩🇪 🇫🇷 🇳🇱 🇧🇪▼ 🇱🇺▼ 🇫🇮 🇯🇵`

## File structure

New platform modules live in smaller responsibility-based folders:

- `includes/Core/` plugin wiring and shortcode registration
- `includes/Admin/` native WordPress admin CMS
- `includes/Data/` repository/data-source logic
- `includes/Frontend/` shortcode renderer
- `includes/I18n/` static translation loader
- `includes/Tickets/` ticket-provider interface, Pretix provider and registry
- `includes/Support/` shared helper functions

Legacy `includes/class-taka-tour-*.php` files remain as thin compatibility shims.

Assets are split into platform files such as `assets/css/frontend.css`, `assets/css/admin.css`, `assets/css/language-switcher.css`, `assets/css/tickets.css`, `assets/js/frontend.js`, `assets/js/admin.js`, `assets/js/media-fields.js` and `assets/js/language-switcher.js` while legacy assets remain in place for compatibility.

## Development workflow

Run the repository lint script before submitting changes:

```bash
./scripts/lint.sh
```

The script checks PHP syntax for all `*.php` files with `php -l` and scans the repository for merge conflict markers. No Composer, npm or PHPUnit test configuration is currently included, so broader functional testing is manual in a WordPress install.

## Migration notes

Existing pages using `[taka_homepage]` and existing CPT data (`taka_event`, `taka_organizer`, `taka_venue`) continue to work. Existing constants such as `TAKA_TOUR_VERSION` map to the new platform constants. Existing class names such as `Taka_Tour_Data` are aliased to the new `TAKA_Platform_*` classes.
